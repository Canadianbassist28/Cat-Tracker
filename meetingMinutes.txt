Scrum 1 (10/3/2019):
	- Talked about storage. ignoring frames
	- talking about mapping algorithms (google indoor mapping API)

Scrum 2 (10/7/2019):
	-Evan looked into mapping algorithms
	-Dylan added class for handleing motion data
	-keven looked into storage formats for raw data from the camera
	-erika continued work on threshold filter


scrum 3 (10/16/2019):
	- Evan Still working with different mapping algorithms
	- Dylan applied classes for motion data

	- Erika continuing threshold filter

scrum 4 (10/21/2019):
	- Evan Added spaghetti code for mapping algorithm
	- Dylan applied more data into the motion class to support mapping
	- Kevin finsihed working on contouring the data points
